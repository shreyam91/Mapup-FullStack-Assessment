# Real-Time Large Dataset Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the Real-Time Large Dataset Dashboard project! This application visualizes large datasets in an interactive and engaging way, allowing users to gain insights from their data in real time. The project is built with **Next.js** for the frontend and utilizes **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** for the backend, alongside **Redis** and **Bull** for task queuing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Continuously updates to reflect the latest data.
- **Interactive Charts**: Users can interact with charts for detailed insights.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on various screen sizes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive layout for easy navigation and data exploration.
- **Background Job Processing**: Efficiently handles data processing and updates using Redis and Bull.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
  - [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) - A composable charting library built on React components.

- **Backend**: 
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast web framework for Node.js.
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database for flexible data storage.
  - [Redis](https://redis.io/) - In-memory data structure store, used for caching and task queuing.
  - [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) - A Redis-based queue for handling background jobs.
